Astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard and Smithsonian
------
I am a 3rd-year NSF Graduate Research Fellow at Harvard Univeristy and the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, working with Karin Ã–berg and Qizhou Zhang. I received my B.A. in physics and astronomy from Harvard College in May 2017. My research focues on observations of chemical complexity during star and planet formation. I use high spatial resolution observations from (sub)mm interferometers such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA) to characterize the chemical environments in which young planets are forming.

Some of my research highlights include:

<ul>
  <li>Mapping the temperature and column densities of complex organic molecules in the massive star-forming region G10.6-0.4 at subarcsecond resolution</li>
  <li>Creation of a 3D kinematic reconstruction of the oxygen-rich supernova remnant N132D (see it <a href="http://www.physics.purdue.edu/kaboom/n132d-anim.mp4">here</a>, or in a VR environment  <a href="https://aas237-aas.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=AE-C0-00-48-D1-0F-E4-BE-FD-08-90-89-FD-CB-AC-DC">here</a>
  <li>Systematic characterization of carbon chain molecules in embedded, low-mass protostars</li>
</ul>

<!---For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
