Astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian
------
I recently completed my PhD in astronomy and astrophysics at Harvard University and the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, working with <a href="https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/people/karin-oberg" style="text-decoration: none">Karin Ã–berg</a> and <a href="https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/people/qizhou-zhang" style="text-decoration: none">Qizhou Zhang</a> and will be joining the University of Virginia as a <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program/2023-nhfp-fellows#section-66b98cc2-bcba-4c71-92d0-217e6ef0e32f" style="text-decoration: none">NASA Hubble Fellowship Program Sagan Fellow</a>. My research focuses on the chemistry of star and planet formation. I use high spatial resolution observations from (sub-)millimeter interferometers such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Submillimeter Array (SMA), and Very Large Array (VLA) to characterize the chemical environments in which young planets are forming.

Some of my research highlights include:

<ul>
  <li>Identified several chemical signatures of recently-confirmed giant protoplanet in the HD 169142 disk, including the first detection of SiS in a planet-forming disk (see ALMA press release <a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-releases/a-surprise-chemical-find-by-alma-may-help-detect-and-confirm-protoplanets/" style="text-decoration: none">here</a>)). </li>
  <li>Mapped the vertical gas structure of CO isotopologues in a large sample of disks and showed that <sup>12</sup>CO heights vary substantially among disks (z/r = 0.1 to nearly ~0.5) </li> 
  <li>Served as a core team member of the <a href="http://alma-maps.info/" style="text-decoration: none">MAPS ALMA Large Program</a> and led two papers on the radial (MAPS III) and vertical (MAPS IV) chemical structure of protoplanetary disks at 10 au scales</li>    
  <li>Mapped complex organic molecules in the massive star-forming region G10.6-0.4 at subarcsecond resolution</li>
  <li>Created a 3D kinematic reconstruction of the oxygen-rich supernova remnant N132D (see it <a href="http://www.physics.purdue.edu/kaboom/n132d-anim.mp4" style="text-decoration: none">here</a>, or in a VR environment <a href="https://aas237-aas.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=AE-C0-00-48-D1-0F-E4-BE-FD-08-90-89-FD-CB-AC-DC" style="text-decoration: none">here</a>)</li>
</ul>

<!---For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
