I am deeply involved in promoting science communication and increasing engagement in astronomy and science more broadly for both students and member of the general public. For my efforts, I was recognized as an <a href="https://aas.org/education/roster-aas-astronomy-ambassadors" style="text-decoration: none">AAS Astronomy Ambassador</a>.  


<h2>Increasing Access and Student Engagement</h2>

</p>
<p> Generating enthusiasm for science is an incredibly important aspect of outreach. I often speak to younger students to introduce them to the most exciting aspects of modern astronomy. Memorable experiences include a hands-on astrochemistry activity I designed as part of the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/shrimp/lectures" style="text-decoration: none">Science Research Mentoring Program</a> at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and as a Seminar Leader for the <a href="https://hauscr.org/hsylc" style="text-decoration: none">Harvard Summit for Young Leaders in China</a>, where I developed and led a two-week-long astronomy course.</p>

</p>
<p> I also greatly enjoying sharing astronomy with the general public, and I am a volunteer for the Observatory Nights held at the Center for Astrophysics. I have also given several public talks at local astronomy clubs including the Gloucester Area, North Shore, and Union County College/Amateur Astronomers, Inc. clubs, as well as continuing education organizations such as the Beacon Hill Seminars.</p> <br>

<h2>Beacon Hill Seminars</h2> I serve as a course coordinator for the "<a href="https://beaconhillseminars.org/events/spring-2021-courses/item/376-unveiling-the-cosmos" style="text-decoration: none">Unveiling the Cosmos</a>" weekly seminar for the <a href="https://beaconhillseminars.org/" style="text-decoration: none">Beacon Hill Seminars</a> organization, where we recruit speakers from the Center for Astrophysics to introduce cutting-edge astrophysical topics to continuing education learners. The course was recently featured in a local community <a href="https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/cambridge-chronicle-tab/2021/05/07/harvard-smithsonian-center-makes-impact-outreach-lifelong-learners/4995959001/" style="text-decoration: none">newspaper</a>.

<h2>Astrobites</h2> I am a member of the <a href="https://astrobites.org/" style="text-decoration: none">Astrobites</a> collaboration and was an active, on-rotation author and editor from 2018-2020. Each month, I wrote a summary article about a recently-published astronomy paper on arXiv, translating the scientific and technical jargon to a more accessible verison aimed for the general public and undergraduate students. A full listing of my Astrobites posts can be found <a href="https://astrobites.org/author/claw/" style="text-decoration: none">here</a>, three of which have been featured on <a href="https://aasnova.org/?s=charles+law+harvard" style="text-decoration: none">AAS Nova</a>.

### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should _italicize_ text.

### Insert Tag

  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>. --->
