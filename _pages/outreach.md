I am deeply involved in promoting science communication and increasing engagement in astronomy and science more broadly for both students and member of the general public. For my efforts, I was recognized as an <a href="https://aas.org/education/roster-aas-astronomy-ambassadors" style="text-decoration: none">AAS Astronomy Ambassador</a>, where I received additional training to augment the impact and reach of my outreach efforts.  


<h2>Increasing Access and Promoting Student and Public Engagement</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;max-width:45%;margin-left:20px;padding-bottom:-50px;display:block;float:right;vertical-align:top"><img src="https://claw-astro.github.io/images/Teaching_HSYLC.png" alt="Teaching a seminar in Shanghai, China during the Harvard Summit for Young Leaders in China." data-api-endpoint="https://claw-astro.github.io/images/Teaching_HSYLC.png" data-api-returntype="File" /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">HSYLC, Shanghai, China</span>
</p>
<p> Generating enthusiasm for science is an incredibly important aspect of outreach. I often speak to younger students to introduce them to the most exciting aspects of modern astronomy. Memorable experiences include a hands-on astrochemistry activity I designed as part of the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/shrimp/lectures" style="text-decoration: none">Science Research Mentoring Program</a> at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and as a Seminar Leader for the <a href="https://hauscr.org/hsylc" style="text-decoration: none">Harvard Summit for Young Leaders in China</a>, where I developed and led a two-week-long astronomy course.</p>

</p>
<p> I also greatly enjoying sharing astronomy with the general public, and I am a volunteer for the <a href="https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/events/public-events" style="text-decoration: none">Observatory Nights</a> held at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. I have also given several public talks at local astronomy clubs including the Gloucester Area, North Shore, Cape Cod, and Union County College/Amateur Astronomers, Inc. clubs, as well as continuing education organizations such as the Beacon Hill Seminars.</p><br>

<h2>Beacon Hill Seminars</h2> I served as the course coordinator for the "<a href="https://beaconhillseminars.org/events/spring-2021-courses/item/376-unveiling-the-cosmos" style="text-decoration: none">Unveiling the Cosmos</a>" weekly seminar for the <a href="https://beaconhillseminars.org/" style="text-decoration: none">Beacon Hill Seminars</a> organization during the Spring 2021 and Fall 2021 sessions. We recruited speakers from the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian to introduce cutting-edge astrophysical topics to continuing education learners. The course was recently featured in a local community <a href="https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/cambridge-chronicle-tab/2021/05/07/harvard-smithsonian-center-makes-impact-outreach-lifelong-learners/4995959001/" style="text-decoration: none">newspaper</a>.

<h2>Astrobites</h2> I am a member of the <a href="https://astrobites.org/" style="text-decoration: none">Astrobites</a> collaboration and was an active, on-rotation author and editor from 2018-2020. Each month, I wrote a summary article about a recently-published astronomy paper on arXiv, translating the scientific and technical jargon to a more accessible verison aimed for the general public and undergraduate students. A full listing of my Astrobites posts can be found <a href="https://astrobites.org/author/claw/" style="text-decoration: none">here</a>, three of which have been featured on <a href="https://aasnova.org/?s=charles+law+harvard" style="text-decoration: none">AAS Nova</a>.

<h2>Subject Matter Expert, NASA JWST Community Events</h2> 

<p style="text-align:center;max-width:45%;margin-right:30px;padding-bottom:-50px;display:block;float:left;vertical-align:top"><img src="https://claw-astro.github.io/images/JWST_Cape_Cod_interview.png" alt="JWST Community Event, Cape Cod Museum of Natural History" data-api-endpoint="https://claw-astro.github.io/images/JWST_Cape_Cod_interview.png" data-api-returntype="File" /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">JWST Community Event, Cape Cod Museum of Natural History</span>
</p>
<p>I serve as a subject matter expert as part of <a href="https://www.universe-of-learning.org/" style="text-decoration: none">NASA's Universe of Learning</a> to promote JWST science to the public and increase interest in astronomy. As part of this program, I have given talks at several science museums, including the <a href="[https://chathamhistoricalsociety.org/events-schedule/tuesday-talks-charles-law/](https://archive.org/details/lctvmav-Telescope-touting_Tour_Hits_the_Cape)" style="text-decoration: none">Cape Cod Museum of Natural History</a>, <a href="https://chathamhistoricalsociety.org/events-schedule/tuesday-talks-charles-law/" style="text-decoration: none">Atwood Museum</a>, and <a href="https://goallevents.com/e/tellus-science-museum-presents-lunch-andamp-learn-a-new-view-on-the-universe-with-charles-law-E200023042301203" style="text-decoration: none">Tellus Science Museum</a> at community events to mark the launch and first images of JWST.</p>



<h2>ALMA Ambassadors Program</h2> 

<p style="text-align:center;max-width:45%;margin-left:20px;padding-bottom:-50px;display:block;float:right;vertical-align:top"><img src="https://claw-astro.github.io/images/ALMA_Amb_picture.jpeg" alt="ALMA Ambassadors standing in front of the NRAO building" data-api-endpoint="https://claw-astro.github.io/images/ALMA_Amb_picture.jpeg" data-api-returntype="File" /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">ALMA Ambassadors at NRAO</span>
</p>
<p>I was selected as an <a href="https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma/ambassadors-program/index" style="text-decoration: none">ALMA Ambassador</a> to receive further professional training about ALMA/interferometry and share that knowledge with other astronomers who are less familiar with the capabilities of ALMA. I gave an online <a href="https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma/community" style="text-decoration: none">webinar</a> about ALMA basics and capabilities and I am now organizing and running a hands-on <a href="https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma/naasc-workshops/nrao-dr-harvard22/index" style="text-decoration: none">data analysis workshop</a> to train others on calibration and imaging techniques to use on their own ALMA observations.

### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should _italicize_ text.

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strong Tag

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag
